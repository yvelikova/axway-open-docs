## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Users membership to multiple organizations

API Manager now enables creating membership to users with multiple organizations (multi-orgs). User accounts can have different roles in each organization the user is a member of. The following are some important changes implemented to enable this new feature.

#### API version update

The multi-orgs feature is available with the API version 1.4 only, meaning that any third-party portals or integrations (for example, SSO) must be updated to use the API 1.4 to avail of the multi-orgs functionality.

This feature is forward compatible, the API 1.4 will work with single-org users, but not backward compatible, you cannot configure multi-orgs in the API 1.4, then revert it to the API 1.3.

The new **API Manager 7.7 API 1.4** is available in OAS3 format on the [Axway Documentation portal](https://docs.axway.com/category/api). API Manager UI uses the API 1.4 by default.

#### Managing multi-orgs users

The following are new changes implemented to facilitate the creation and maintenance of multi-orgs users in API Manager:

* The API Administrator can now assign a user to more than one organization using the [User API](http://apidocs.axway.com/swagger-ui-NEW/index.html?productname=apimanager&productversion=7.7.0&filename=api-manager-V_1_4-oas3.json#/Users) or the Application Developer's **Create** and **Edit** user interface. For more information, see [Manage users](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_admin/#manage-users).

* The ability for the Organization Administrator to manage users within its own organization has changed to avoid privileged escalation concerns. OrgAdmins can only edit or delete multi-orgs users from organizations where they are OrgAdmins. To learn more about these restrictions, see [Organizations and user roles in API Manager](/docs/api_mgmt_overview/key_concepts/api_mgmt_orgs_roles/#organizations-and-user-roles-in-api-manager).

* Integration via SSO has changed to facilitate configuring users from an external IDP to multi-orgs. You can use the new attribute, `orgs2role`, to assign a user to multi-orgs. This attribute can be populated via:

    * A direct attribute in the IDP.
    * An LDAP mapping in the service-provider.xml file.
    * A filter configured in Policy Studio, which allows to overwrite the `orgs2role` map value.

For more information on configuring multi-orgs users, see [Configure API Manager Single Sign On](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_sso/saml_sso_config/).

#### Account changes

When a user account is configured to be a member of multi-orgs, it is automatically authenticated and associated with its primary organization, the first organization in their membership list. Using the drop-down menu, users can navigate between their organizations and the UI will display the options based on their role, which can be either `orgAdmin` or `User`.

#### Organization administrators can publish APIs

By default, Organization administrators require the approval of an API administrator to publish and unpublish APIs that were created in their organization without approval from an API Administrator. By setting the `api.manager.orgadmin.selfservice.enabled` system property to `true`, the OrgAdmin will no longer require approval, and will be able to directly publish and unpublish APIs.

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.

<!-- Use this section to describe any changes in the behavior of the product (as a result of features or fixes), for example, new Java system properties in the jvm.xml file. This section could also be used for any important information that doesn't fit elsewhere. -->

### Improvements to the update process

This update introduces configuration changes during the application of the update. After applying this update, any configuration fragments and FED files will need to be upgraded to be compatible with the September 20 release. There is a new mechanism in place that checks the compatibility of configuration fragments and FED files, and prevents older versions from being deployed and used in error. For example, after applying this update you will not be able to export a configuration fragment or FED file and deploy it to a gateway running the [July update](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apimgr_relnotes/). Any attempt to do so will produce the following error:

```
Version mismatch error: API Gateway has version 7.7.20200930, new configuration has version 7.7.0.
```

Existing configuration fragments, FED files, Policy Studio projects, and configuration stored in SCM can all be [upgraded](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_poldev/general_import/#upgrade-configuration-from-an-earlier-version) to be compatible with this release. After they are upgraded, configuration and files exported will not be compatible with older updates, so it is recommended to back up these files before upgrade in case you want to use them in an older update.

### OpenJDK JRE update to v8u265

API Gateway 7.7 and API Manager 7.7 support OpenJDK JRE, and this release includes Zulu OpenJDK v8u265.

OpenJDK v8u265 searchs for wildcard certificates. If the wildcarded domain is a top-level domain under which names can be registered, then a wildcard is not allowed. Matching approach has not changed for the second-level and lower-level domain names. In case you have certificates with wildcards characters in top-level domain you must recreate them with proper top-level domain names.

Examples of matching domain names:

```javascript
SubjectAlternativeName [
 DNSName: *.com     // will match e.g. 'google.com'
 DNSName: *.*.com   // will match e.g. 'mail.google.com'
 DNSName: *         // no longer match 'abc'
 DNSName: abc.*     // no longer match 'abc.com'
 ]
```

### Removed broken and risky algorithms from sFTP server

Broken and risky algorithms utilized in sFTP protocols exposed in all previous versions of API Gateway have been removed to mitigate possible attacks against those services. This means that any FTP client that uses any of the removed algorithms **cannot connect** to the sFTP server after this release.

The list of removed broken and risky algorithms is:

* **Ciphers**: `arcfour256`, `arcfour128`, `aes128-cbc`, `3des-cbc`, `blowfish-cbc`, `aes192-cbc`, `aes256-cbc`
* **Mac Algorithms**: `hmac-md5`, `hmac-sha1`, `hmac-sha1-96`, `hmac-md5-96`
* **Key exchange**: `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group18-sha512`, `diffie-hellman-group17-sha512`, `diffie-hellman-group16-sha512`,
  `diffie-hellman-group15-sha512`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha256`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`

The sFTP server currently supports:

* **Authentication Methods**: `Username/Password`, `Public Key`
* **Ciphers**: `aes128-ctr`, `aes192-ctr`, `aes256-ctr`
* **Mac Algorithms**: `hmac-sha2-512`, `hmac-sha2-256`
* **Signatures**: `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`, `ssh-rsa, ssh-dss`
* **Key exchange**: `ecdh-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdh-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdh-sha2-nistp521`, `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256`
* **Compressions**: `none`, `zlib`, `zlib@openssh.com`

## Deprecated features

<!-- Add features that are deprecated here -->

As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering.

The following capabilities have been deprecated.

### Antivirus scanners

API Gateway already supports the industry standard Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP). From the November 2020 update the following embedded antivirus scanners will be removed:

* McAfee
* Sophos
* Clam AV

Content scanning is still supported using the ICAP filter, which provides out-of-the-box integration with ICAP-capable servers provided by Symantec, McAfee, OPSWAT and others, promoting ease of deployment and operational control.

## Removed features

<!-- Add features that are removed here -->

To stay current and align our offerings with customer demand and best practices, Axway might discontinue support for some capabilities. As part of this review, the following features have been removed:

### Run `update-apimanager.py` script to update API Manager

The requirement to run `update-apimanager.py` has been removed from the [Upgrade steps - Single-node upgrade example](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).

Updating API Manager is now carried out through any of the following procedures:

* Applying the latest API Gateway update to an existing installation will update the API Manager `config` script. This running `config` can then be pulled into a Policy Studio project.
* Policy Studio project upgrades. Importing an existing API Manager Policy Studio project will upgrade API Manager. The upgrade is also applied when creating a new project from an existing FED file.
* API Manager FED files can be upgraded using the [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) script.
* The [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options) script will apply API Manager updates to any existing projects.

{{< alert title="Note" color="" >}} If deploying an earlier update, prior to September 20, it is still required to use the `update-apimanager.py` script.{{< /alert >}}

## Fixed issues

### Policy Studio help documentation

This update includes changes to the Policy Studio documentation, but the version of the documentation (Eclipse Help) shipped with Policy Studio is out of sync with the online documentation and does not include these changes.

We are working to rectify this issue in a future update. In the meantime, you can find the up to date documentation online at [Develop in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_policydev/).

## Update a classic (non-container) deployment

These instructions apply to API Gateway and API Manager classic deployments only. For container deployments, see [Update a container deployment](#update-a-container-deployment).

### Prerequisites

This update has the following prerequisites in addition to the [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

1. Shut down any Node Manager or API Gateway instances on your existing installation.
2. Back up your existing installation. You can use the `update_apigw.sh` script to take a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory as detailed in the [API Gateway server install steps](#install-the-api-gateway-server-update), or you can manage your own backups as detailed in [API Gateway backup and disaster recovery](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/manage_operations/#api-gateway-backup-and-disaster-recovery). Ensure that you back up any customized files. You should merge updated files instead of copying them back directly to avoid any regex matching issues, whether you manage your own backups or not. For example, the following directories might contain customized files:

   ```
   webapps/apiportal/vordel/apiportal
   webapps/emc/vordel/manager/app
   webapps/emc
   system/conf/apiportal/email
   system/conf
   samples/scripts/
   tools/filebeat-VERSION-PLATFORM
   ```
3. If you have an existing Apache Cassandra installation, ensure that you back up your data (Cassandra and `kpsadmin`), and that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly in `cassandra.in.sh` and `cassandra.in.bat`.
4. Remove the old Filebeat folder `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. Check any customized files to see if they are compatible with the new version. See [Filebeat](#filebeat-v6-2-2) for more information.
5. On Linux, remove existing capabilities on product binaries (which might prevent overwriting files):

   ```
   setcap -r INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/platform/bin/vshell
   ```

### FIPS mode only

If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Run `togglefips --disable` to turn FIPS mode off.
2. Start the Node Manager to move the JARs.
3. Stop the Node Manager.
4. Install the API Gateway update as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
5. Start the Node Manager.

In Policy Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Policy Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Policy Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Policy Studio using the `policystudio -clean` command.

In Configuration Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Configuration Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Configuration Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Configuration Studio using the `configurationstudio -clean` command.

### Installation

This section describes how to install the update on existing 7.7 installations of API Gateway or API Manager.

* If you have installed an existing version of API Manager, installing the API Gateway server update automatically also installs the updates and fixes for API Manager.
* If you have installed a licensed version of API Gateway or API Manager 7.7, you do not require a new license to install updates.

#### Install the API Gateway server update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway 7.7 server installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove any previous patches from your `INSTALL_DIR/ext/lib` and `INSTALL_DIR/META-INF` directories (or the `ext/lib` directory in an API Gateway instance). These patches have already been included in this update. You do not need to copy patches from a previous version.
3. Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 server Update file into a new directory. For example:

   ```
   mkdir 77update
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Core_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
   ```

    {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.{{< /alert >}}
4. Run the [`update_apigw.sh` script](#update-apigw-sh-script) from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify  your API Gateway installation directory using the `--install_dir` option. For example:

   ```
   ./update_apigw.sh --install_dir /opt/Axway-7.7/
   ```
5. Restart your Node Manager and API Gateway instances on the local machine.

##### `update_apigw.sh` script

Run the `update_apigw.sh` script with the `--help` option to see the available options:

```
./update_apigw.sh --help
```

The script generates a trace file in the `update-output/trace` directory. Use the `--tracelevel` option to change the level of tracing.

The script takes a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory and places it in a `tar` file in the `update-output/backups` directory. Specify a different directory using the `--backup_dir` option. To manage your own backups, use the `--no_backup` option.

To run the script without user interaction, specify `--mode unattended` option.

Running the `update_apigw.sh` script performs the following steps:

1. Check that the installation directory is valid.
2. Check that the user who owns the API Gateway binaries is the same user running the `update_apigw.sh` script.
3. Check that the Node Manager and API Gateway instances that run on the local machine are not running.
4. Take a backup unless `--no_backup` has been specified.
5. Install the update content into the API Gateway installation directory.
6. Perform all of the steps that were performed by a post installation script in earlier updates. This includes JRE cleanup, `system/lib/modules` cleanup, third-party and Axway JAR cleanup, apply `acl.json` fix, apply passphrase obfuscation fix, and apply modifications to Node Manager entity store configuration. Fixes are only applied if they have not previously been applied.

#### Install the Policy Studio update

To install the update on your existing Policy Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.

You must also remove the files `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` if they exist in the directory `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio`.

For installations running on Windows 7, you must manually unzip the Policy Studio update.
{{< /alert >}}

Run the `update_policy_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `policystudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `policystudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Policy Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_policy_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`).{{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update over the `policystudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Policy Studio with `policystudio -clean`.

A backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/policystudio/<date_time>`.

#### Install the Configuration Studio update

To install the update on your existing Configuration Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.

You must also remove the files `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` if they exist in the directory `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio`.

For installations running on Windows 7, you must manually unzip the Configuration Studio update.
{{< /alert >}}

Run the `update_configuration_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `configurationstudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `configurationstudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Configuration Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_configuration_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`).{{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update over the `configurationstudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Configuration Studio with `configurationstudio -clean`

A backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/configurationstudio/<date_time>`.

#### Install the API Gateway Analytics update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway Analytics 7.7 installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway Analytics instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove old third-party libraries by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/system/lib/modules
   ```
3. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/platform/jre
   ```
4. Verify the owners of API Gateway binaries before extracting the update.

   ```
   ls -l INSTALL_DIR/analytics/posix/bin
   ```
5. Using the same user who owns the API Gateway Analytics binaries, unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Analytics Update over the `analytics` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory. For example:

   ```
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Analytics_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C /opt/Axway-7.7/analytics/
   ```
6. Change to the `analytics` directory in your installation:

   ```
   cd INSTALL_DIR/analytics
   ```
7. Run the post-install script for API Gateway Analytics.

   ```
   apigw_analytics_sp_post_install.sh
   ```

You must also install an update for your existing API Gateway 7.7 server.

### After installation

The following steps apply after installing the update.

#### API Gateway

To allow an unprivileged user to run the API Gateway on a Linux system, perform the following steps:

1. Add the following line to the `INSTALL_DIR/system/conf/jvm.xml` file:

   ```
   <VMArg name="-Djava.library.path=$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64/server:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib/engines:$VDISTDIR/ext/$DISTRIBUTION/lib:$VDISTDIR/ext/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib:system/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib"/>
   ```
2. Run the command `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep cap_sys_rawio=+ep' INSTALL_DIR/platform/bin/vshell` to allow the API Gateway to listen on privileged ports.

#### API Manager

When API Manager is installed, you must run the `update-apimanager` script after the API Gateway post-install script to ensure that all paths are up-to-date. For details, see [Run update-apimanager](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/#run-update-apimanager).

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}} Before executing the `update-apimanager` script:

* Apply the update to all API Gateways.
* Ensure that all Node Managers and API Gateway instances are running.

{{< /alert >}}

## Update a container deployment

If a FED file is provided as part of building the API Manager container, you must follow these steps to update the FED with the configuration changes:

1. Install the update on a installation of the API Gateway.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   /opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/posix/bin/update-apimanager --fed <path to old file>FED --oa <path to update file>FED
   ```

You do not need to run any API Manager instances.

The FED now contains the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.
