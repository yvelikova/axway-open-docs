description: Self-service your support interactions with the Support Portal API.
---

The Support Portal API offers a way for Axway customers to self-service their support interactions, and also provides the ability to communicate with Axway on enhancement requests based on the [Customer Enhancements Requests version 2.0 process](https://community.axway.com/s/article/New-Axway-Enhancement-Request-Process).

It provides for building applications to manage support cases, business service requests, and customer enhancement requests. Supplemental endpoints allow for retrieving information about the accessible support accounts as well as purchased or subscribed-to products and services.

Access the API at [Support Portal API](https://apis-developer.axway.com/).
