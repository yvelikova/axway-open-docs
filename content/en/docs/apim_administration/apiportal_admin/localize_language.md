## Change API Portal language

You can change the API Portal UI texts from the default English to another language.

### Install a language

User interface strings are stored in language-specific resource files. To add these resource files for a new language, you must install the language.

1. In the Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI) top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Language(s)**.
2. Click **Install Languages**.
3. Find and select the language to install, and click **Install**.
4. After the installation is finished, click **Extensions > Language(s) > Installed** and ensure that **Site** is selected at the top of the page.
5. To set the installed language as the default language of your API Portal, click the star button in the row for that language.

   ![Install language](/Images/APIPortal/joomla_install_lang.png)

   {{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}You can change the default language of JAI independently from your API Portal. Select **Administrator** on the **Languages: Installed** page and click the star button in the row for the required language. You can also select any of the installed languages when you log in to JAI.{{< /alert >}}

### Add API Portal UI strings to the installed language

API Portal UI strings are not included in the installed language resource files, so you must add the required strings for the new language.

The UI strings are stored in initialization (`.ini`) files. Each language has its own `.ini` file that control the UI text shown in API Portal. By default, the API Portal UI strings are included only in the English `.ini` file (`en-GB.com_apiportal.ini`). To change the language shown in API Portal, you must have a translation of the English `.ini` file for that language.

Because the `.ini` files are text files, you can use professional translation services to get the file translated. Alternatively, you can manually translate the UI strings yourself.

#### Add a translated UI string file

You can send the file `en-GB.com_apiportal.ini` file for translation to a professional translation service, and include the translated file in your API Portal installation.

To find the `en-GB.com_apiportal.ini` file that must be translated, go to the following directory in your API Portal installation:

```
/opt/axway/apiportal/htdoc/language/en-GB/
```

Before you send the file for translation, it is recommended to rename the file to `en-GB.com_apiportal.ini.txt`. When you receive the translated file, you should remove any `.txt` extension again before proceeding with the following steps.

To install the translated file:

1. Go to the resource file directory of the language you installed (for example, `/opt/axway/apiportal/htdoc/language/fr-FR/`).
2. Copy the translated `.ini` file to the directory.
3. Ensure that the language code in the file name of the translated `.ini` file matches the language code of the installed language, and the extension of the file is `.ini` (for example, `fr-FR.com_apiportal.ini`). Rename the file, if needed.
4. Go to your API Portal, refresh the page, and verify that the UI texts have changed to your new language.

#### Manually translate the UI strings

1. Copy the following file from the English resource file directory:

   ```
   /opt/axway/apiportal/htdoc/language/en-GB/en-GB.com_apiportal.ini
   ```
2. Go to resource file directory of the language you installed (for example, `/opt/axway/apiportal/htdoc/language/fr-FR/`), and paste the copied file there.
3. Rename the copied `.ini` file to match the language code of the installed language (for example, `fr-FR.com_apiportal.ini`).
4. Open both the English `.ini` file and the copied `.ini` file.
5. In the English `.ini` file, find a UI text you want to change (such as the text `Connect with a community of developers` at the bottom of the API Portal sign in page), and copy the UI string ID (`COM_APIPORTAL_HOME_CONNECT`).
6. In the copied `.ini` file, find the same UI string, and change the value of the string to the new language translation.
7. Repeat the last two steps for all the UI strings on all your API Portal pages that you want to change to the new language, and save the file.
8. Go to your API Portal, refresh the page, and verify that the UI texts have changed to your new language.

### Change the text overrides on the sign in page

Some texts on the sign in page are controlled by text overrides, and you have to change them separately in the `.override` file.

1. Go to the language override directory:

   ```
   /opt/axway/apiportal/htdoc/language/overrides/
   ```
2. Copy the file `en-GB.override`.
3. Paste the file in the same directory, and rename it to match your new language (for example, `fr-FR.override`).
4. Open the renamed file, find the UI string with the value `Login Name`, and change the value of the string to the new language translation (for example, `Identifiant`).
5. Find the UI string with the value `Password`, and change the value of the string to translate it (for example, `Mot de passe`).
6. Save the file, and go to your API Portal.
7. Go to the API Portal sign in page, refresh the page, and verify that the UI texts have changed to your new language.

## Provide API Portal in multiple languages

You can provide API Portal in multiple languages at the same time to cater for your API consumers from different countries. The API consumers can use language-specific URLs to access API Portal in their own language.

Unlike when localizing API Portal to a single language, you are not simply substituting the language with another one. Instead, when providing several language versions of your API Portal, you must duplicate the API Portal elements and content for each language in addition to changing the UI texts.

You do not have to install a language to Joomla! before configuring the required components. However, it might help you to find the correct details when configuring a language.

### Add a new content language and main menu

To add a new content language and main menu, follow these steps:

1. In the JAI left navigation bar, click **Language(s) > Content Languages**.
2. Click **New** to add a new content language.

   {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you have already installed a new language, a corresponding content language will already exist for that language and you can skip the following steps 3 to 7, and continue from step 8.{{< /alert >}}
3. On the **Details** tab, enter the **Title** and **Title Native** for the new language. The titles can be the same.
4. Enter the Joomla! **Language Tag**. Ensure that you enter the tag in the correct format. You must use "`-`" instead of "`_`" (for example, `fr-FR`).
5. In **URL Language Code**, enter the language identifier to use in the language-specific URL (for example, `fr`). The identifier must be unique for each language.
6. Set **Status** to **Unpublished**, and click **Save & Close**. For more details on the parameters, see the tutorial for [Joomla! Language Switcher](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Setup_a_Multilingual_Site/Language_Switcher).
7. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Menus > Manage > Add New Menu**.
8. In **Title**, enter the title to be shown in drop-down lists (for example, `Main menu (fr)`).
9. On the **Menu Details** tab, in **Menu Type**, enter a system identifier for the new main menu (for example, `mainmenufr`).
10. Click **Save & Close**.

### Clone the main menu items

You must duplicate the API Portal main menu for each language.

1. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Menus** and select the main menu to clone.
2. To clone all the menu items at once, click the Check All Items check box and click **Batch**.
3. In **Set Language**, select the correct content language.
4. In **To Move or Copy**, locate the correct main menu for the language and select **Add to this menu**.
5. Select **Copy** to make a copy of the menu items.
6. Click **Process**.
7. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Menus** and select the main menu you cloned the menu items to.
8. To set the default home page, click the star in the row for the **Home** menu item.
9. To rename the cloned menu items, click each menu item to edit it, and change **Menu Title** to the correct translation (for example, `Home(2)` to `Accueil`).
10. Click **Save & Close**.
11. Repeat for each menu item.

### Duplicate the page template styles

You must also duplicate your page template styles for each language. By default, API Portal uses the Purity III template style.

1. In the JAI left navigation bar, click **Templates > Styles**.
2. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III - Default`) to open it.
3. Click the arrow next to the **Save** button at the top left of the window, and select **Save as Copy**.
4. Edit the **Style Name** to indicate the language (for example, `purity_III - fr`).
5. Select the respective language as the **Default**. This sets this template as the default for pages using the selected language.
6. Click the **Navigation** tab and change the **Menu** to the correct main menu for the language.
7. Click the **Assignment** tab and assign the menu items from the correct language to the template. To select or deselect all menu items, click the toggle button next to the main menu title.
8. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.

### Duplicate the homepage template style

You must also duplicate your homepage template style for each language.

1. In the JAI left navigation bar, click **Templates > Styles**.
2. Click **apiportal-homepage** template style to open it.
3. Click the arrow next to the **Save** button at the top left of the window, and select **Save as Copy**.
4. Edit the **Style Name** to update the name of your new homepage.
5. Click the **Navigation** tab and change the **Menu** to the correct main menu for the language.
6. Click the **Assignment** tab and select only **Home** from the **Main menu** of the correct language.
7. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.

### Create homepage modules for the new language

On the Home page layout there are available positions where you can add modules. When installing a new language, it is a common practice to duplicate the **Home Page Banner** and the **Home tiles** modules, and translate them for the new language. To create a new module:

1. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Modules** and click **New**.
2. Select module type (for example, **Home Page Banner**).
3. Select **Position**  (for example, **api-home-banner**).
4. For the **Language**, select the new installed language.
5. On the **Menu assignment** tab, select **Only on the pages selected** from the **Module assignment** list.
6. Select the Home page of the new language from the **Menu selection** field.
7. Click **Save**  

### Publish additional languages

1. Ensure that you have completed all the steps described in [Change API Portal language](#change-api-portal-language) for each language you want to publish.
2. In the JAI left navigation bar, click **Language(s) > Content Languages**.
3. Ensure that the **Status** for all the languages you want to publish is set to **Publish**.
4. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Plugins**, and ensure the **System - Language Filter** plugin is enabled.
5. Open your API Portal home page in a browser, and change the language code in the URL to one of the languages you have published. For example, change `https://<your API Portal URL>/en/` to `https://<your API Portal URL>/fr/`. You are redirected to the API Portal home page in that language.

## Provide a language switcher

You can provide API Portal in multiple languages, and enable your API consumers from different countries to change languages using a language switcher.

To enable a language switcher, you need to have a main menu for each language you are providing (including one for English), and an additional main menu for all languages. Similarly, you need to have template styles for each language (including one for English), and an additional template style for all languages.

### Install new languages

To install new languages, follow these steps:

1. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Language(s)**.
2. Click **Install Languages**.
3. Find and select the language to install, and click **Install**.
4. In the JAI left navigation bar, click **Language(s) > Content Languages**.
5. Set the **Status** of the new language to **Published**.

### Create main menus

To enable a language switcher, you need to have a main menu for each language you are providing (including one for English), and an additional main menu for all languages.

After following this process you will have the following main menus:

* Main menu - All
* Main menu - FR
* Main menu - EN

#### Create a main menu for all languages

First, create a main menu that will be the default main menu for all languages. This main menu will have only one menu item.

1. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Menus > Manage > Add New Menu**.
2. In **Title**, enter the title to be shown in drop-down lists (for example, `Main menu - All`).
