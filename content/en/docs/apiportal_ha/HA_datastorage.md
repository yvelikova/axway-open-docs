## Data storage

API Portal stores API Management data both in relational database management system (RDBMS) and as files on disk. The stored data includes, for example, configuration data and logs, all API Portal customizations, as well as articles and their related data posted in Joomla!, blog, or discussion forum.

The following table describes where API Portal stores data. In RDBMS, `#_` stands for the table prefix of the DB schema. The default `INSTALL_DIR` is `/opt/axway/apiportal/htdoc`.

Data type

Storage location

**System**

API Manager settings (for example, IP address, certificates)

RDBMS: `#_apiportal_configuration`

Files on disk: `INSTALL_DIR/administrator/components/com_apiportal/assets/cert`

Logs

Files on disk:

-   Software installation: `/var/log/httpd/error_log`
-   `INSTALL_DIR/logs`

Public API mode key file

Files on disk: The custom path you specified for the encryption key at install time

### Recommended API Portal data replication

API Portal data between API Portal instances or datacenters is replicated either automatically or manually.

Data can be replicated automatically using the following:

-   **RDBMS cluster**: The configured database cluster replicates data between all database nodes in the cluster. For a technical example, see this article about [database cluster setup](https://support.axway.com/en/articles/article-details/id/180417) on Axway Support.
-   **Shared file system solution**: A shared storage solution, like a cluster or shared network file system, synchronizes data across all instances. For a technical example, see this article about [shared file system](https://support.axway.com/en/articles/article-details/id/180405) on Axway Support.

In the manual, or static data replication, you must use a promotion tool to promote data from one API Portal instance to another. For details, see this article about the [promotion tool](https://support.axway.com/en/articles/article-details/id/180277) on Axway Support.

It is recommended to use automatic data replication whenever possible, and to configure RDBMS cluster for the databases and shared file system. For more details, see [Deployment architecture](#Deployme).

The replication options depend on the data type and where it is stored, as shown in the following table:

Data type

Replication between datacenters

**System**

API Manager settings (IP, cert)

Automatic, RDBMS cluster.

Logs

Not applicable (local file-based data only).

**Customization**

Automatic (RDBMS cluster) or static process (deployment process).

**Localization**
