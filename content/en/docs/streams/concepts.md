## AMPLIFY Streams general concepts

There are several key concepts in a pub/sub service:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Message | The data that transits through the service. |
| Topic | An entity that represents a feed of messages. |
| [Publisher](../publishers) | Creates messages and send them in a topic. |
| [Subscriber](../subscribers) | Subscribes to a topic to receive published messages. |
