## Errors during subscription

When a problem occurs during subscription, an error event is sent.

Example:

```json
{
    "datetime": "2018-09-03T13:16:02.120Z",
    "subscriptionId": "f6cc363f-6516-4dc9-b1ad-1352fc51fd64",
    "code": 40000,
    "category": "subscription",
    "message": "Subscriber error"
}
```

It contains:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| datetime | Datetime of the error |
| subscriptionId | Unique identifier of the subscription |
| code | Status code of the error |
| category | Category to which the error belongs. Refer to [Error Categories](#error-categories) section.|
| message | Human readable message describing the error

For programmatic error processing, only the code and category must be used.

### Error Categories

All errors are organized into different categories:

* **subscription** for errors that may occur during the client subscription phase
* **server** for internal errors that may occur on Streams platform components
* **topic** for errors related to the data processing and transformation of a topic
* **publication** for errors related to the publication in a topic

#### Subscription Errors

This error category is intended for situations where the error was caused by the subscriber (client).

}
```
