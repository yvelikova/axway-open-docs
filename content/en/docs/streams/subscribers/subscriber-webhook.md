## Overview

Streams Webhook subscriber allows clients to be notified via a HTTP Post requests made by Streams to the endpoint that was provided during their subscription.

## Creating a Webhook subscription

You can create a webhook subscription by making an HTTP Post request on the following endpoint:

`POST /subscribers/webhook/topics/{topicID}/subscriptions`

The body must contain a JSON webhook subscription configuration as follow:

```json
{
    "webhookUrl": "https://valid.url/of/webhook",
    "subscriptionMode": "snapshot-only|snapshot-patch"
}
```

| Configuration Entry | Mandatory | Default value | Description |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| webhookUrl | yes | n/a | URL which will be called by Streams in order to inform the subscriber that a new event/message has been published in the topic identified by {topicId}. |
| subscriptionMode | no | Default subscription mode defined in the topic's configuration | Refer to [subscription modes](/docs/streams/subscribers/#subscription-modes) section |

Once the webhook subscription is successfully created, Streams will start notifying the subscriber at the specified `webhookUrl`.

| X-Axway-Streams-Event-Id | Identifier of the event. |
| X-Axway-Streams-Event-Type | Type of the payload (snapshot, patch or error). |
| Webhook Event Payload | See [Webhook payload samples](#webhook-payload-samples). |
