* Understand what API rate limiting is and how it can be useful
* Configure and test rate limiting on your API using the AMPLIFY Central UI
* Configure and test rate limiting on your API using the AMPLIFY CLI

## What is API rate limiting?

Rate limiting is a way to protect the backend service underlying (or implementing) your API. The use of resources underlying your API are protected from more aggressive consumer activity (or spikes in total API calls) which could overwhelm the backend service capacity.

API providers typically measure processing limits in Transactions Per Second (TPS). Rate limiting at the API level is a way to enforce a maximum TPS for all of your API consumers. In AMPLIFY Central, we provide rate limiting around the API Proxy activity.

### AMPLIFY Central API rate limiting

AMPLIFY Central currently provides a fixed window rate limiting implementation with a one second window. Simply explained, each second on the minute your API gets a budget of API transactions. Each valid API transaction uses one unit of the budget. At the beginning of each second the budget is reset to its configured value. If the budget is exhausted before the second is over, all API transactions are refused until the budget is reset. A valid API transaction is an API transaction that has been successfully processed by AMPLIFY Central.

AMPLIFY Central allows for two levels of enforcement for rate limiting. At the proxy level, rate limiting affects all API transactions regardless of the consuming application. At the proxy and application level, rate limiting affects all API transactions originating with a specific application. You can enforce one or both levels with AMPLIFY Central.

## Use the AMPLIFY Central UI to configure rate limiting

To begin, [register an api proxy](/docs/central/quickstart/#register-an-api).

### Set a proxy rate limit on your API

1. Navigate to the **API Proxies** tab.
2. Click the API proxy name to open the API proxy details page.
3. On the **Policies** tab, edit the rate limit policy under the **Request to backend** section. 
4. Enter the desired TPS and click the checkbox to save the configuration.

![Enter the desired TPS](/Images/central/proxy_rate_limit_box.png)

A new revision with the desired rate limit configuration is created. Deploy the new revision for the configuration to take effect.

### Test the rate limit configuration

#### Simple test with docker and curl

This sample test uses curl packaged in a docker container to start a few simultaneous API transactions and displays the return status for each attempt. Replace `<your_url_here>` with an endpoint of your proxy. 

```
docker run curlimages/curl:7.66.0 -s -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}:%{http_code}\n" -Z "<your_url_here>#[1-5]"
```

Example run for the sample API with a rate limit of 2 TPS:

```
$ docker run curlimages/curl:7.66.0 -s -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}:%{http_code}\n" -Z "https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments#[1-5]"
https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments#1:429
https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments#3:429
https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments#2:429
https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments#4:200
https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments#5:200
```

#### Constant traffic test

[K6](https://docs.k6.io/docs/welcome) is a testing tool that can help exemplify a scenario closer to how your API will be used in the real world.

K6 is configured using the JavaScript language. Save the following script as `rate-limit-test.js`.

```js
import http from "k6/http";
import { sleep } from "k6";
import { Counter } from "k6/metrics";

var passes = new Counter("passed")
var ratelimited = new Counter("ratelimited")

export function setup() {
    // warm up DNS
    var res = http.get(`${__ENV.TEST_URL}`)
}

export default function() {
    var res = http.get(`${__ENV.TEST_URL}`)

    if (res.status === 429) {
        ratelimited.add(1)
    } else {
        passes.add(1)
    }
}
```

Using the dockerised version of K6 we'll run a test mimicking 20 users doing 20 TPS against your API proxy for 30 seconds. Replace `<your_url_here>` with an endpoint of your proxy.

```
docker run -i loadimpact/k6 run * -e TEST_URL="<your_url_here>" --rps 20 -u 20 -m 20 -d 30s < rate-limit-test.js
```

Sample run against a proxy with a 5 TPS rate limit.

```
docker run -i loadimpact/k6 run - -e TEST_URL="https://test-e4f77cd969cdaf3a0169ce16c8320000.apicentral.axwayamplify.com/music/v2/instruments" --rps 20 -u 20 -m 20 -d 30s < rate-limit-test.js
```

It produces the final report:

Notice the passed rate closely matching the enforced rate limit.

### Remove a proxy rate limit

1. Navigate to the **API Proxies** tab.
2. Click the API proxy name to open the API proxy details page.
3. On the **Policies** tab, edit the rate limit policy under the **Request to backend** section.
4. Clear the text field and click the checkbox to save the configuration.

![Clear up the textbox](/Images/central/proxy_no_rate_limit_box.png)

A new revision with no rate limit is created. Deploy the new revision for the configuration to take effect.

## Use the AMPLIFY CLI to configure rate limiting on your API

Ensure that you are logged in to AMPLIFY CLI using the service account.

### Create the configuration file and promote your API

The AMPLIFY Central DevOps CLI allows you to define the `rateLimit` configuration under the `policies` section of your API configuration file. For example:

```
version: v1 # Version of the file format
apiVersion: v1 # This version ensures backward compatibility and would not mandate a frequent update from a client side
proxy:
    name: 'Musical Instruments Rate Limited' # name of the proxy
    basePath: /examples/ratelimit/api/v1 # base path of the proxy
    swagger: 'https://ec062a054a2977120b7e721801edb38ca24dfbb3.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/apidoc/swagger.json' # Swagger url of the proxy
    policies:
        clientAuth:
            type: pass-through
        rateLimit:
            perProxy: 5 # the desired TPS limit for your API
    tags: ['musical', 'instruments', 'ratelimit']
    team:
        name: 'Default Team'
```

The `perProxy` field specifies the desired TPS limit for your API.

Create the API proxy:

```
amplify central proxies create /myservices/my_service_config.yaml
```

Promote the proxy to the test runtime group:

```
amplify central proxies promote /myservices/my_service_config.yaml --target="Test Runtime"
```

To visualize the API proxy in AMPLIFY Central UI, select **API Proxies** in the left navigation bar, and click the appropriate API proxy in the list. Verify the rate limit configuration in the **Policies** tab.

### Apply a rate limit for each application consuming your API

When your API is protected with an authentication method you can enforce a rate limit for each application consuming your API. In the sample configuration below the API is protected by api key authentication. Under `rateLimit` we can specify two configurations. The `perProxy` value defines a rate limit at the API level, meaning all calls . The `perProxyAndApp` value defines a second level of rate limiting enforced for each application consuming the API. The two application under `apps` will be limited to 3 TPS individually, as defined by the `perProxyAndApp` configuration, but traffic from both apps will also be limited to 5 TPS as defined by the `perProxy` configuration.

```
version: v1 # Version of the file format
apiVersion: v1 # This version ensures backward compatibility and would not mandate a frequent update from a client side
proxy:
    name: 'Musical Instruments Rate Limited' # name of the proxy
    basePath: /examples/ratelimit/api/v1 # base path of the proxy
    swagger: 'https://ec062a054a2977120b7e721801edb38ca24dfbb3.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/apidoc/swagger.json' # Swagger url of the proxy
    policies:
        clientAuth:
            type: api-key
        rateLimit:
            perProxy: 5 # the desired TPS limit for your API
            perProxyAndApp: 3 # the default TPS limit for each application consuming the API
    tags: ['musical', 'instruments', 'ratelimit']
    apps:
    - name: Rate Limited App 1
    - name: Rate Limited App 2
    team:
        name: 'Default Team'
```

### Apply a specific rate limit for an application consuming your API

In some cases you might want to configure some applications to have a dedicated rate limit when consuming your API. The example below shows how this scenario can be configured. The `overrides` section under `rateLimit` defines a specific rate limit of 3 TPS for the application `Rate Limited App 1`, when consuming your API. The application `Rate Limited App 2` will inherit the default rate limit of 1 TPS.

```
version: v1 # Version of the file format
apiVersion: v1 # This version ensures backward compatibility and would not mandate a frequent update from a client side
proxy:
    name: 'Musical Instruments Rate Limited' # name of the proxy
    basePath: /examples/ratelimit/api/v1 # base path of the proxy
    swagger: 'https://ec062a054a2977120b7e721801edb38ca24dfbb3.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/apidoc/swagger.json' # Swagger url of the proxy
    policies:
        clientAuth:
            type: api-key
        rateLimit:
            perProxy: 5 # the desired TPS limit for your API
            perProxyAndApp: 1 # the default TPS limit for each application consuming the API
            overrides:
              - appName: Rate Limited App 1
                perProxyAndApp: 3 # this app can individually do 3 TPS
    tags: ['musical', 'instruments', 'ratelimit']
    apps:
    - name: Rate Limited App 1
    - name: Rate Limited App 2
    team:
        name: 'Default Team'
```

### Disable the rate limit for an application consuming your API

In some cases you might want to exempt an application from having an individual rate limit. In the example below the `overrides` section exempts `Rate Limited App 1` from the 1 TPS rate limit defined for all other applications.

```
version: v1 # Version of the file format
apiVersion: v1 # This version ensures backward compatibility and would not mandate a frequent update from a client side
proxy:
    name: 'Musical Instruments Rate Limited' # name of the proxy
    basePath: /examples/ratelimit/api/v1 # base path of the proxy
    swagger: 'https://ec062a054a2977120b7e721801edb38ca24dfbb3.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/apidoc/swagger.json' # Swagger url of the proxy
    policies:
        clientAuth:
            type: api-key
        rateLimit:
            perProxy: 5 # the desired TPS limit for your API
            perProxyAndApp: 1 # the default TPS limit for each application consuming the API
            overrides:
              - appName: Rate Limited App 1
                disablePerProxyAndApp: true # this app is not limited individually
    tags: ['musical', 'instruments', 'ratelimit']
    apps:
    - name: Rate Limited App 1
    - name: Rate Limited App 2
    team:
        name: 'Default Team'
```

### Specify a rate limit for some application consuming your API

The following example shows how to set a rate limit for each individual application. There is no rate limit on the API as a whole. The `overrides` section defines a 3 TPS individual rate limit for `Rate Limited App 1`, a 5 TPS individual rate limit for `Rate Limited App 2`. `Rate Limited App 3` will not be rate limited at all.

```
version: v1 # Version of the file format
apiVersion: v1 # This version ensures backward compatibility and would not mandate a frequent update from a client side
proxy:
    name: 'Musical Instruments Rate Limited' # name of the proxy
    basePath: /examples/ratelimit/api/v1 # base path of the proxy
    swagger: 'https://ec062a054a2977120b7e721801edb38ca24dfbb3.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/apidoc/swagger.json' # Swagger url of the proxy
    policies:
        clientAuth:
            type: api-key
        rateLimit:
            overrides:
              - appName: Rate Limited App 1
                perProxyAndApp: 3 # this app is limited individually
              - appName: Rate Limited App 2
                perProxyAndApp: 5 # this app is limited individually
    tags: ['musical', 'instruments', 'ratelimit']
    apps:
    - name: Rate Limited App 1
    - name: Rate Limited App 2
    - name: Rate Limited App 3
    team:
        name: 'Default Team'
```

### Remove the rate limit configuration

Delete the `rateLimit` section from your API configuration file while keeping the same proxy name, as in the example:

```
version: v1 # Version of the file format
apiVersion: v1 # This version ensures backward compatibility and would not mandate a frequent update from a client side
proxy:
    name: 'Musical Instruments Rate Limited' # name of the proxy
    basePath: /examples/ratelimit/api/v1 # base path of the proxy
    swagger: 'https://ec062a054a2977120b7e721801edb38ca24dfbb3.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/apidoc/swagger.json' # Swagger url of the proxy
    policies:
        clientAuth:
            type: pass-through
    tags: ['musical', 'instruments']
    team:
        name: 'Default Team'
```

Create a new revision of the API proxy:

```
amplify central proxies create /myservices/my_service_config.yaml
```

Promote the new API version and verify that the API proxy is not rate limited anymore.

## Review
