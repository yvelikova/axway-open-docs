## Before you start

* Read [AMPLIFY Central mesh governance overview](/docs/central/hybrid_overview).
* You will need a basic knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon EC2 instances, and associated tools.
* You will need to be familiar with Kubernetes and Helm, including running Helm, kubectl, and kops commands.

## Objectives

Learn how to build a basic Amazon EC2 private cloud hybrid environment and add the required tools to enable you to access and manage it remotely from a client system.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="" >}}For the latest Amazon EC2 build instructions, see the [Set up AMPLIFY Central mesh governance documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/Axway/Setup-Amplify-Mesh-Governance).{{< /alert >}}

## Minimum requirements

* Amazon EC2 instance with Kubernetes and Helm:
    * Kubernetes 1.11.7 or later recommended
    * Helm 2.13 or later recommended
* Public facing fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Amazon EC2 cluster
* Client system (for example, Linux VM) with the following tools installed for accessing and managing your Amazon EC2 environment remotely:
    * AWS CLI 1.16 recommended - Enables you to interact with AWS services from the command line. See the [AWS CLI installation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/li-chap-install.html).
    * kubectl 1.13 recommended - Enables you to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes from the command line. See the [kubectl installation documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
    * kops 1.11 recommended - Helps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain Kubernetes clusters from the command line. See the [kops installation documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md).
    * Helm 2.13 or later recommended - Enables you to install the Axway proprietary service mesh layer later, and to export Helm charts. See the [Helm installation documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm).

## Build an Amazon EC2 hybrid environment

Follow these guidelines to build a basic Amazon EC2 hybrid environment manually.

### Set up Amazon EC2

1. To create an Amazon EC2 environment, follow the five steps in the [Amazon EC2 set up documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html).
2. To launch and connect to an Amazon EC2 instance, follow the first two steps in the [Amazon EC2 get started documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html). When launching the instance, choose a Linux AMI and an instance type of `t2.medium`.

### Add Kubernetes to Amazon EC2

To install a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using kops, follow the steps in the [Kubernetes installation on AWS documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/custom-cloud/kops/).

### Access the Amazon EC2 cluster from your client

When the cluster is created, use kops to export the configuration from the Amazon EC2 cluster to your client system. This updates a file in your home directory (`~/.kube/config`) with information about contacting the cluster, which allows you to interact with your cluster from your client using kubectl, Helm, and so on.

Usage:

```
kops export kubecfg --name CLUSTER_NAME --state STATE_STORAGE_LOCATION
```

Example:

```
kops export kubecfg --name kubernetes-cluster.example.com --state s3://amazonaws.com
```

* `kubernetes-cluster.example.com` is the public FQDN (or name) of your cluster
* `s3://amazonaws.com` is the Amazon S3 cloud storage bucket location defined when Kubernetes was added to your cluster

### Configure Helm on Amazon EC2

Install Helm on your cluster and add the Axway public repository to Helm:

1. To install the Helm server (Tiller) on the connected cluster:

    ```
    helm init
    ```

2. Verify the Helm version:

    ```
    helm version
    Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.13.0", GitCommit:"2e55dbe1fdb5fdb96b75ff144a339489417b146b", GitTreeState:"clean"}
    Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.13.0", GitCommit:"2e55dbe1fdb5fdb96b75ff144a339489417b146b", GitTreeState:"clean"}
    ```

3. Add the Axway public Helm repository to your installation:

    ```
    helm repo add axway https://charts.axway.com/charts
    "axway" has been added to your repositories
    ```

4. Verify that the Axway public repository has been added:

    ```
    helm repo list
    NAME            URL
    stable          https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
    local           http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts
    axway           https://charts.axway.com/charts
    ```

## Validate the Amazon EC2 hybrid environment

Use the following commands to validate your environment using kubectl or kops.

kubectl:

```
    kubectl get nodes
    NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    ip-172-0-33-242.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    node     25d   v1.10.12
    ip-172-0-35-225.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    node     25d   v1.10.12
    ip-172-0-59-93.us-west-2.compute.internal    Ready    master   25d   v1.10.12
    ip-172-0-70-60.us-west-2.compute.internal    Ready    node     25d   v1.10.12
```

kops:

```
kops validate cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: kubernetes-cluster.example.com
...
Your cluster kubernetes-cluster.example.com is ready
```
