description: Traffic is always initiated by the Agent to AWS and AMPLIFY
  Central. No sessions are ever initiated back to the Agent.
---
{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The Axway API Gateway connectivity to AMPLIFY Central is currently available in an alpha review mode; current functionality and configuration may change before release. Therefore, this connectivity is available for trial use only and is not supported for production API management or connectivity.{{< /alert >}}

## Data destinations

The destination for:

* Agent Authentication data is `login.axway.com`

* AWS API Gateway data is  `apicentral.axway.com`

* API Event data is `ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com`

## Communication ports

All outbound traffic is sent over SSL via TCP / UDP.

Open the following ports to benefit from all the Agent functionalities:

**Outbound**:

| Host                                       | Port               | Protocol  | Data                                |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| apicentral.axway.com                       | 443                | HTTPS     | API definitions, Subscription info  |
| login.axway.com                            | 443                | HTTPS     | Authentication                      |
| ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com  | 453                | TCP       | API event data                      |

**Inbound**:

The docker container does not expose any ports outside of the container. Within the container the following listen:

| Host                                       | Port               | Protocol  | Data                                |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Docker Container                           | 8989 (default)     | HTTPS     |Serves the status of the agent and its dependencies for monitoring  |

## Validation

### Direct Connection

**Connecting to AMPLIFY Central and Login hosts:**

```shell
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://apicentral.axway.com
```

```shell
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://login.axway.com
```

A return of **"200"** validates the connection was established.

**Connecting to AMPLIFY Central Event Traffic host:**

```shell
curl ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com:453
```

A return of **"curl: (52) Empty reply from server"** validates the connection was established.

### Connection via Proxy

**Connecting to AMPLIFY Central and Login hosts:**

```shell
curl -x {{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://apicentral.axway.com
```

```shell
curl -x {{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://login.axway.com
```

A return of **"200"** validates the connection was established.

**Connecting to AMPLIFY Central Event Traffic host:**

```shell
curl -x socks5://{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com:453
```

A return of **"curl: (52) Empty reply from server"** validates the connection was established.

## Troubleshooting

### Curl connection to ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com

* **Error:**

  ```shell
  curl: (6) Could not resolve host: ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com
  ```

    * **Cause:** The host making the call can’t resolve the ingestion-lumberjack DNS name.

    * **Possible Resolution:** Tell curl to resolve the hostname on the proxy:

      ```shell
      curl -x socks5h://{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com
      ```

* **Error:**

  ```shell
  curl: (7) No authentication method was acceptable.
  ```

    * **Cause:** The SOCKS proxy server expected an authentication type other than what was specified.

    * **Possible Resolution:** Provide authentication to the proxy:

      ```shell
      socks5://{{username}}:{{password}}@{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}}
      ```

      The Agents only support the use of username/password authentication method for SOCKS connections.
