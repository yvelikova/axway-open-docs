description: Use the following environment variables to control your Discovery
  and Traceability agents
---


As the Discovery and Traceability agents share many parameters, it is more efficient to use environment variables and reference these parameters, instead of declaring parameters twice.

To maintain a shareable collection of environment files, one approach is to create an `env_vars` file per environment, which contains simple key value pairs.  By default, agent configuration files are looking for corresponding environment variables before looking on the configuration file property. This file can be used for both modes of the agent (binary VS Docker container).
  
Note that the agent (binary mode) is expecting system environment variables, which you can create based on the `env_vars` file with either this command: `export $(grep -v '^#' env_vars | xargs)` or if you prefer: `set -a && source env_vars && set +a`.

Note that the Docker image of the agent is expecting this `env_vars` as a parameter of the Docker runner `docker run --env-file <PATH>/env_vars ...`

Some variables/properties have a default known value so that there is no need to parameter them.

## Minimum recommended variables

In order to be able to switch easily from one environment to another, the following environment variables list is a good starting point:

```
#
#API Manager connectivity
#
APIMANAGER_HOST=ApiManagerHostName (localhost by default)
APIMANAGER_PORT=ApiManagerPortNunber (8075 by default)
APIMANAGER_AUTH_USERNAME=AnApiManagerUserName
APIMANAGER_AUTH_PASSWORD=AnApiManagerUserPassword
#
#API Gateway connectivity
#
APIGATEWAY_HOST=ApiGatewayHostName (localhost by default)
APIGATEWAY_PORT=ApiGatewayPortNumber (8090 by default)
APIGATEWAY_AUTH_USERNAME=AnApiGatewayOperatorUser
APIGATEWAY_AUTH_PASSWORD=AnApiGatewayOperatorUserPassword
#
#API Central connectivity
#
CENTRAL_AUTH_CLIENTID=AnApiCentralServiceAccountClientId
CENTRAL_ORGANIZATIONID=TheOrganizationIDfromAMPLIFYCentral
CENTRAL_ENVIRONMENT=AMPLIFYCentralEnvironmentName
CENTRAL_TEAM=AMPLIFYCentralTeamName
```

If you are either struggling with a variable value or you want to benefit from the advanced agents features (API filtering / SSL security / proxy access / logging), the following section describe all the variables the agents (discovery / traceability) rely on.

## Complete variable list for advance features

You can extend the previous minimum variable list with the following variables. Some are common to all agents and some are specific to an agent.

### Common variables to both agents

| APIMANAGER_SSL_CIPHERSUITES             | An array of strings. It is a list of supported cipher suites for TLS versions up to TLS 1.2. If CipherSuites is nil, a default list of secure cipher suites is used, with a preference order based on hardware performance.

| APIMANAGER_SSL_INSECURESKIPVERIFY       | Controls whether a client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name. If true, TLS accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   |
