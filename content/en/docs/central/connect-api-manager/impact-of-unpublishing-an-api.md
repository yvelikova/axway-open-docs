## Unpublishing your API in publishToEnvironmentAndCatalog mode

Assume you have an API in API Manager that had previously been discovered by the agent and pushed to AMPLIFY Central as a Catalog item. Now you choose to unpublish that API in API Manager. If the agent's mode is set to `publishToEnvironmentAndCatalog`, then:

* The agent updates the **state** of the ConsumerInstance in the AMPLIFY Central environment to UNPUBLISHED.
* The agent updates the **status** of the ConsumerInstance in the AMPLIFY Central environment to UNPUBLISHED.
* The status tag for the catalog in AMPLIFY Central is now marked as UNPUBLISHED.
