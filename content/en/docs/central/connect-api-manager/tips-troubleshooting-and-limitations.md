title: Get help with Connected API Manager
draft: false
weight: 130
description: This section provides troubleshooting, known limitations and
  restrictions that you may encounter while you are working with the connected /
  managed environment for AMPLIFY Central and Axway API Manager. It also
  provides tips you may find useful when working with this environment.
---

## Tips

### API summary

In Axway API Manager, you can edit an unpublished API to include an API summary (description) that displays in the API's Catalog Overview once the API is published. If the API summary field is empty when the API is published, then "API From V7 APIManager" is displayed in the Catalog Overview. To update the API summary once the API is published, you must unpublish the API.

## Troubleshooting

| Question                                                   | Answer                                                                                                                                                                       |   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Why can't Discovery Agent connect to Axway API Manager?    | Make sure that the Axway API Manager hostname and port are correct. Also Make sure that the connected user has the Axway API Manager Administrator role.                     |   |
| Why can't Traceability Agent connect to Axway API Gateway? | Make sure that the Axway API Gateway hostname and port are correct. Also Make sure that the connected user has the Axway API Gateway Operator role.                          |   |
| Why can't my agents connect to AMPLIFY Central?            | Go to AMPLIFY Central UI > Access > Service Accounts and make sure that the Service Account is correctly named and valid. Make sure that the organizationID and team are correct. |   |
| I have the following error: `AMPLIFY Central - FAIL (error creating request header. bad response from AxwayId: 400 Bad Request)`| Make sure that the Service account set up is properly spelled (refer to `central.clientId` property). Verify that the public/private key pair is the one corresponding to the service account |   |
| I have the following error: `API Manager - FAIL (API Manager Failed. Error sending request to V7 - Get 'https://IP_ADDRESS:8075/api/portal/v1.3/proxies/:' x509: cannot validate certificate for IP_ADDRESS because it doesn't contain any IP SANs. Check API Manager configuration for HOST or PROXYURL.)`    | By default, SSL connectivity tries to validate the host in the certificate chain. If your hostname is not present in the chain, the error is raised. You can disable this check by using `ssl.insecureSkipVerify: true` in the apimanager section of the agent configuration.                      |   |
| Why don't I see traffic in AMPLIFY Central?                | Make sure that the Condor URL is accessible from the machine where Traceability Agent is installed.                                                                          |   |
| Why isn't my API discovered?                               | Make sure that the tag set on the frontend API has a correct name and value compared to `apimanager.filter` list tags defined in the Discovery Agent configuration file. See [Filtering APIs to be discovered](/docs/central/connect-api-manager/filtering-apis-to-be-discovered/). Also be sure the APIs on API Manager are published                                                          |   |

## Limitations

APIs including AWS signing / HTTP Basic / Invoke policy / 2-way SSL security cannot be discovered, as these features are not currently supported in AMPLIFY Central.

A change of front-end image only is not detected. Changing the name of the API will create a new one on Central and not delete the previous one.
