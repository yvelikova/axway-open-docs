| APIMANAGER_SSL_INSECURESKIPVERIFY       | Controls whether a client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name. If true, TLS accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   |
