This topic details the steps you must follow to configure API Manager SSO. It also lists the prerequisites for configuring SSO, describes the configuration files used to configure SSO, and provides some usage guidelines.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start to configure API Manager SSO:

* You must have a third-party IdP installed and running.

## Configuration files

The following configuration files are used for API Manager SSO.

### A keystore (for example `sso.jks`)

This file is the truststore generated by an administrator and referenced in `service-provider.xml`.

* Contains the key that the SSO agent uses to sign requests. The exported public key must be stored by the IdP.
* Located in your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`).
* For more information, see [Step 1 – Configure the IdP](#step-1-configure-the-idp).

### `service-provider.xml`

Defines the Service Provider (SP), the SAML Identity Provider (IdP), and the mappings that can be made by the SAML IdP. In this case the SP is API Manager.

* Located in your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`).
* For more information, see [Step 2 – Create the service-provider.xml file](#step-2-create-the-service-provider-xml-file).

### `idp.xml` (optional)

* Required only if you are specifying the IdP by file.
* Located in your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`).
* For more information, see [Specify the IdP by file](#specify-the-idp-by-file).

### `jvm.xml` (optional)

* Used to configure the SSO cookie domain name and required only in a load-balanced environment.
* Located in the folder `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf`.                                                                                                         |

You can use the sample files included in your API Gateway installation at:

```
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso
```

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}} Copy the sample files to your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`) and edit them as appropriate.{{< /alert >}}

The following sample files are included:

* `ShibbolethIDP` folder:
    * Sample Shibboleth configuration files to help you configure Shibboleth as an IdP. These configuration files are part of the Shibboleth installation and can be found in the respective Shibboleth installation folders. For more information on Shibboleth, see the [Shibboleth documentation](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/Home).
    * Sample `service-provider.xml` where the IdP is specified by file using `idp.xml`.
    * Sample `idp.xml`.
* `keycloak` folder:
    * Sample `service-provider.xml` file that uses a URL to specify the IdP.
    * Sample `service-provider-apiportal.xml` for configuring API Portal SSO. For more details, see
        [Configure API Portal single sign-on](/docs/apiportal_admin/sso/sso_config/).

## Usage guidelines

When configuring API Manager SSO, follow these guidelines.

### Host names

Always use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for the host name. Avoid using IP addresses or `localhost` in the configuration.

### User role mapping and API Manager organizations

You must manually configure the mapping of user roles between the IdP and API Manager in the file `service-provider.xml`. For more information, see [Mapping syntax](/docs/apimgr_admin/sso/sso_mapping/#mapping-syntax).

An SSO user is mapped to one of three SSO roles:

* `Administrator`
* `Operator`
* `User`

The SSO role to API Manager role mapping is as follows:

| SSO role        | API Manager role                            | Notes                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Administrator` | API administrator (for example, `apiadmin`) | The API administrator does not belong to a specific organization  |
| `Operator`      | Organization administrator                  | The organization administrator belongs to a specific organization |
| `User`          | API consumer                                | The API consumer belongs to a specific organization               |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If the IdP does not return any role, a user is assigned the default role of `User` (API consumer) in API Manager. {{< /alert >}}

The `service-provider.xml` mapping effectively maps a user to an organization. To authenticate a user successfully using SSO:

* If the user's role is `User` or `Operator`, the user must belong to a specific organization (at most one organization) and that organization must already exist in API Manager. An API Manager administrator user can add the organizations in advance. For more information on adding organizations, see [Manage organizations](/docs/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_admin/#manage-organizations).
* If the user's role is `Administrator`, that user does not need to belong to a specific organization.

For more information on API Manager roles, see [API Manager access control](/docs/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_admin/#api-manager-access-control).

### SSO users and SSO login

The following restrictions apply to SSO users and SSO login:

* SSO authenticated users cannot change their own passwords.
* To log in using SSO, users cannot use the standard login URL (`https://FQDN:PORT`). Instead, users must use the following SSO login URL:

    ```
     https://FQDN:PORT/api/portal/v1.3/sso/login/
    ```

* `FQDN` is the FQDN of the machine where API Gateway is running, and `PORT` is the API Manager listening port (for example, `https://gateway.example.com:8075/api/portal/v1.3/sso/login/`).
* If a user has already authenticated using SSO (for example, by previously logging in to Decision Insight), they must still use the SSO login URL for API Manager. If they are already authenticated, they are automatically redirected to the API Manager home page at `https://FQDN:PORT/home` and presented with a view appropriate to their API Manager role.

## Step 1 – Configure the IdP

API Manager uses a certificate to sign SAML requests. The IdP requires the public key to verify the validity and provenance of the SAML requests from API Manager. To configure the IdP, you must import the public key to the IdP.

In this step you will create a keystore, export the public key of the keystore you created, and import it to your IdP.

First, use the Java `keytool` utility to set up a keystore containing a key pair:

1. Change directory to your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`).
2. Execute `keytool` to create a keystore. For example, the following command generates a keystore with the alias `ssokey` in the file `sso.jks`:

```
keytool -genkey -alias ssokey -keyalg RSA -keystore sso.jks -keysize 2048
```

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}The values `ssokey` and `sso.jks` are used in the sample files included in the API Gateway installation. You can use different values when generating the keystore, but you must update the sample files with the new values.{{< /alert >}}

Next, export the public key of the keystore you created. For example, use one of the following commands to export it using Java `keytool`.

This example exports it to `publickey.txt`:

```
keytool -list -rfc -keystore sso.jks -alias ssokey > publickey.txt
```

This example exports it to `publickey.cer`:

```
keytool -export -keystore sso.jks -alias ssokey -file publickey.cer
```

Finally, import the public key to your IdP. Consult the documentation for your IdP for details.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}} For more information on the `keytool` commands and options, see the [Java keytool documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html).{{< /alert >}}

## Step 2 – Create the service-provider.xml file

In this step you will create a `service-provider.xml` file based on a sample file, and update it with the correct values for your keystore, your IdP, and the appropriate mappings for your IdP:

1. Copy either of the `service-provider.xml` sample files included in the `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso` folder of your API Gateway installation to your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`).

    The sample file in the `ShibbolethIDP` folder specifies the IdP by file, and the sample in the `keycloak` folder specifies the IdP by URL.

2. In the `ServiceProvider` section, update the `keystore`, `keystorePassphrase`, and `keyAlias` fields with the correct values for your keystore.

    ```
       <ServiceProvider
          ...
          keystore="conf/KEYSTORE_FILE"
          keystorePassphrase="KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE"
          keyAlias="KEY_ALIAS"
          ...
       </ServiceProvider>
    ```

3. For example, if you generated a keystore called `sso.jks` with a passphrase `abc123` and an alias called `ssokey`, the settings in `service-provider.xml` would be as follows:

    ```
       <ServiceProvider
          ...
          keystore="conf/sso.jks"
          keystorePassphrase="abc123"
          keyAlias="ssokey"
          ...
       </ServiceProvider>
    ```

4. In the `SamlIdentityProvider` section, update the `metadataUrl` field as detailed in [Specify the IdP by file](#specify-the-idp-by-file) or [Specify the IdP by URL](#specify-the-idp-by-url).
5. In the `SAMLIdentityProvider` section, update the `Mappings` section with the appropriate mapping of IdP attributes to API Manager attributes. For more information on the mapping syntax, see [Mapping syntax](/docs/apimgr_admin/sso/sso_mapping/#mapping-syntax).
6. Update any other fields as required. For more information on the elements in the `service-provider.xml` configuration file, see [service-provider.xml configuration file reference](/docs/apimgr_admin/sso/sso_mapping/#service-provider-xml-configuration-file-reference).

### Specify the IdP by file

To specify the IdP by file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `idp.xml` sample file included in the `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/sso/ShibbolethIDP` folder of your API Gateway installation to your API Gateway instance folder (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/conf`).
2. In the `idp.xml` file:
    * Replace the place holder `CHANGE THIS : Replace this text with your IDP_CERTIFICATE` with the certificate of your IdP that is used for signing SAML tokens.
    * Replace all instances of the placeholders `<IDP_FQDN>:<IDP_SOAP_PORT>` and `<IDP_FQDN>:<IDP_HTTP_PORT>` with the fully qualified domain name and port of your IdP.
3. Set the `metadataUrl` field of the `SamlIdentityProvider` section of the `service-provider.xml` file to the value `./idp.xml`.

    For example:

    ```
       <SamlIdentityProvider
          entityId="https://axwayidp.localdomain/idp/shibboleth"
          metadataUrl="./idp.xml"
          ...
       </SamlIdentityProvider>
    ```

### Specify the IdP by URL

To specify the IdP by URL, set the `metadataURL` field to the metadata URL of the IdP in the `SamlIdentityProvider` section of the `service-provider.xml` file. For example:

```
   <SamlIdentityProvider
      entityId="https://YourkeycloakIDPServerFQDN:8443/auth/realms/Axway"
      metadataUrl="https://YourkeycloakIDPServerFQDN:8443/auth/realms/Axway/protocol/saml/descriptor"
      ...
   </SamlIdentityProvider>
```

When specifying an IdP by URL, you might need to set up a truststore JKS file:

* `sso.jks` – Contains the key used by the SSO agent to sign requests. This key needs to go to the IdP.
* `truststore.jks` – This is a separate truststore that is used for HTTPS communication between the SSO agent and the IdP while retrieving metadata online.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}You can use the same keystore for all of the operations.{{< /alert >}}

## Step 3 – Configure SSO in Policy Studio

Perform the following steps in Policy Studio:

1. Open the configuration of your API Manager-enabled API Gateway instance. For example, select **File > New Project from an API Gateway instance**.
2. Navigate to **Environment Configuration > Listeners > API Gateway > API Portal > Paths** in the Policy Studio tree.
3. Click **Add > Static File Provider**.
4. Set **Relative Path** to `/sso-login-failed`.
5. Ensure that the settings for this relative path match those for the `/login-failed` relative path, the only difference being the path name.
6. Set **File** to `$VDISTDIR/webapps/apiportal/login.html`.
7. Enter the following values to the additional headers table, and click **OK**:

    | HTTP Header               | Value                    |
    |---------------------------|--------------------------|
    | `Content-Security-Policy` | `frame-ancestors 'none'` |
    | `X-Frame-Options`         | `DENY`                   |

8. Edit each of the servlets (`API Portal v1.2 (‘v1.2’)` and `API Portal v1.3 (‘v1.3’)`) as follows:
    * Edit the property `jersey.config.server.provider.classnames`. In the **Value** field add the class name `com.vordel.common.apiserver.filter.SSOBindingFeature` to the existing comma-separated list of class names.
    * Add a new property. In the **Name** field enter the name `CsrfProtectionFilterFactory.refererWhitelist` and in the **Value** field enter the URL of the IdP (for example, `https://sample_idp_host:8443`).

9. Deploy the configuration to the API Manager-enabled API Gateway instance.

## Step 4 – Configure SAML endpoint URLs in the IdP

You must configure the SAML endpoints of API Manager in your IdP. Consult the documentation for your IdP for details. The following examples are for Keycloak IdP.

| Keycloak field name                                 | API Manager endpoint URL                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL**     | `https://<your_API Manager_host_FQDN>:8075/api/portal/v1.3/sso/login/post`  |
| **Assertion Consumer Service Redirect Binding URL** | Leave this field blank                                                      |
| **Logout Service POST Binding URL**                 | `https://<your_API Manager_host_FQDN>:8075/api/portal/v1.3/sso/logout/post` |
| **Logout Service Redirect Binding URL**             | `https://<your_API Manager_host_FQDN>:8075/api/portal/v1.3/sso/logout/post` |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you are also configuring SSO for API Portal, you must configure the endpoint URLs separately for both API Manager and API Portal. For more details, see
[Configure API Portal single sign-on](/docs/apiportal_admin/sso/sso_config/).{{< /alert >}}

## Step 5 – Configure the SSO cookie domain name (optional)

This implementation of SSO uses a cookie, which is created on the API Gateway server and sent to the client's browser. The cookie includes the domain name, which is set to the API Gateway host name by default. For example, if the host name is `apigateway.wks.us.axway.int`, the domain name in the cookie contains the substring `apigateway.wks.us.axway.int`.

If API Gateway is hidden behind a load balancer, you might need to change the cookie domain name as the client's browser is not aware of the internal API Gateway host name and therefore might not accept this cookie.

To change the default domain name to a sample domain name such as `axway.int`:

1. Create a file called `jvm.xml` in the folder `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf` (if it does not already exist).
2. Add the following setting:

    ```
    <ConfigurationFragment>
      <VMArg name="-Dcom.axway.sso.domain.name=axway.int" />
    </ConfigurationFragment>
    ```

    {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Do not prefix the domain name with a period (for example, do not use the value `.axway.int`). {{< /alert >}}

## Step 6 – Restart API Gateway

Finally, you must restart the Node Manager and the API Gateway instance to enable the changes in `service-provider.xml` and `jvm.xml` files to be applied. After the restart, your users will be able to log in to API Manager using SSO.
