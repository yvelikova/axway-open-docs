  The `__init__` method is the constructor, and you can pass it default arguments for any arguments the user does not supply, as with the name argument. You can supply named parameters when you instantiate a class or call a method.                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The `self` term is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is the equivalent of the Java `this` reference. Calling it `self` is a Jython convention. You can use any name. Unlike Java, Jython requires you to prefix any instance variable with `self`. Failing to provide the `self` prefix usually results in an exception. When creating a bound method, the first parameter to the method is always `self`.  |
| Variables can be public, protected, or private.       | In Jython, variables and class methods can either be public or private. There is no protected level of visibility as there is in Java. They are public by default. To make them private, you can prefix them with a double underscore. For example, the following variable is private:
